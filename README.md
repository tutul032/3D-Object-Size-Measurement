# Machine vision based detection and size measurement of objects on a conveyor belt:
1. 3D point cloud obtained via triangulation

2. Background subtraction applied on interested objectets

4. Cuboid drawn on the 3D point cloud of each object to measure the dimention by subtracting the cuboid coordinates
